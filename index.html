                    Beer is a beverage with a rich diversity of styles, each boasting its own unique history and characteristics. The American craft beer market offers a wide array of these styles, raising intriguing questions: What distinguishes these different styles of beer? Which states have a rich craft beer culture? This project aims to explore these varied beer styles from multiple perspectives.</p>

The dataset includes a range of variables, but for this visualization, we concentrate on those pertinent to our theme: beer style, ABV (Alcohol By Volume), IBU (International Bitterness Units), and the state of origin.</p>

Interactive elements are created using D3.js, a JavaScript library specializing in data-driven visualizations. Non-interactive visuals are developed with ggplot2 in R and then refined in vector design software, Sketch, for enhanced visual appeal.

                    The treemap visualization displays various beer styles, with each rectangle's area indicating the market presence of that style, measured by the number of products. Alongside, I include the percentage of each style* to highlight quantitative differences. This treemap is chosen for its dual ability to show the variety of beer styles and their respective market shares, effectively aligning with my goal to showcase the diversity of the market and pinpoint the most common styles for further analysis.

*The percentage of each style is calculated by dividing the number of products in that style by the total number of products.

                    Beer product entries were grouped by style. To enhance the treemap's readability, styles with fewer entries were excluded. The cutoff was set at 30 products; styles with fewer were were considered as less relevant. This process identified five styles with the most products, which were then used as a focus group in subsequent visualizations.

                    Above is a grouped bar chart with a circular layout. The data is divided into five groups based on five beer styles, showing the number of beer products produced in different states.

                    Colors are used to encode different styles. In group, the bars are arranged in descending order. In this way, we can see which states produce more. A advantage of circular layout is efficient use of space. One disadvantage of the circular layout is that the bar data is more difficult to read. It is necessary to use more prominent auxiliary lines, thus, the circular grids are drawn over the bars.
